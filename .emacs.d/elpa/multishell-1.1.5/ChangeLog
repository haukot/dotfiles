	multishell - remove plain file copy to replace it with a subtree clone

2016-01-04  Ken Manheimer  <ken.manheimer@gmail.com>

	multishell - remove custom var
	multishell-non-interactive-process-buffers

	Multishell should only be concerned with shell-mode and shell-mode 
	derived buffers. Clarify that, and remove obsoleted 
	multishell-non-interactive-process-buffers. That var wasn't being 
	properly used, anyway - the residual var
	non-interactive-process-buffers was mistakenly being used, it's now
	removed, too.

2016-01-04  Ken Manheimer  <ken.manheimer@gmail.com>

	multishell - refactor for name-then-path, and use a valid release
	number.

	Hopefully this update is out there before anyone gets used to the old 
	path-then-name format. (I haven't seen it in list-packages, but someone 
	indicated that it might be out.)

2016-01-04  Ken Manheimer  <ken.manheimer@gmail.com>

	multishell - V. 0. Change "multishell:" to "multishell-", use
	everywhere.

	For ELPA conformance.

	I'm also changing the version number to 0 to defer initial release. I 
	discovered a big, user-exposed change I want to make, and need to iron 
	it out before anyone gets used to the previous format.

2016-01-03  Ken Manheimer  <ken.manheimer@gmail.com>

	multishell.el - Remove (redundant) maintainer line, fix remote cd
	ordering.

	Also, remove redundant requires.

2016-01-03  Ken Manheimer  <ken.manheimer@gmail.com>

	multishell - Use actual email address, rather than obscured, in
	packaging.

	multishell - new package

	Author: Ken Manheimer <ken dot manheimer at gmail...> Version: 1.0.0 
	Maintainer: Ken Manheimer <ken dot manheimer at gmail...> Created: 1999
	-- first public availability Keywords: processes URL:

	Commentary:

	Easily use and manage multiple shell buffers, including remote shells. 
	Fundamentally, multishell is the function `multishell:pop-to-shell -
	like pop-to-buffer - plus a keybinding. Together, they enable you to:

	* Get to the input point from wherever you are in a shell buffer,
	* ... or to a shell buffer if you're not currently in one.
	* Use universal arguments to launch and choose among alternate shell
	buffers,
	* ... and select which is default.
	* Prepend a path to a new shell name to launch a shell in that
	directory,
	* ... and use a path with Emacs tramp syntax to launch a remote shell.

	Customize-group `multishell` to select and activate a keybinding and
	set various behaviors.

	See the pop-to-shell docstring for details.
